This is the Private Events for
[*The Odin Project*](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations#project-2-private-events).

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
